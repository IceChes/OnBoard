# SDMD (prev. OpenDrive)
## Summary
##### Compact, inexpensive, open source motor controller for 1lb combat robots. Capable of controlling 2 motors and providing 5V BEC power. Uses the servo protocol. Comes with overcurrent protection so the board will attempt to preserve itself in the event of an overcurrent fault.

## Plan
##### This is a roughly $50 set of boards with full 5pc one-sided assembly. The OpenDrive PCB was designed to be mostly (or entirely) user-solderable. If you purchase parts and board discretely and solder them yourself, the price can drop to as low as $11 per board.

## Design
##### Thanks to Hack Club and NHRL. Designed in KiCad 7.0. NOTE: THE MISO AND MOSI PINS ON THE ICSP HEADER ARE SWAPPED/MISWIRED. YOU WILL HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS WHEN WIRING YOUR PROGRAMMER.
